\chapter{Equations}

    In this chapter, we would like to answer to two questions: what are the gravitational test particles? What are the gravitational sources?

\section{Gravitational test particles}

    By the Einstein's equivalence principle, we can associate inertial observers to freely falling objects. Consider a test-particle with $4$-velocity $u^\mu = \dv{x^\mu}{\tau}$ subjected only to gravity. It must move along a straight line $x^i = x^i_0 + u^i_0 t$ which satisfies Newton's law 
    \begin{equation*}
        \dvd{x^i}{t} = 0 ~.
    \end{equation*}
    which can be put in a covariant form since $\dvd{t}{t} = 0$ 
    \begin{equation*}
        \dvd{x^\alpha}{\tau} = \gamma^2 \dvd{x^\alpha}{t} = 0 ~.
    \end{equation*}
    In a local inertial frame $\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu} = 0$, therefore 
    \begin{equation*}
        0 = \dvd{x^\mu}{\alpha} = \dvd{x^\mu}{\alpha} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu} \dv{x^\mu}{\tau} \dv{x^\nu}{\tau} = u^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\alpha ~,
    \end{equation*}
    which is the geodesic equation. Notice that this happens only at a point in which the test particle and the freely falling observer trajectories cross. However, it is a frame-independent result and it can be generalised by saying that test particles follows geodesic, called world-lines as well. Furthermore, if we consider the inertial observer a test particle at rest, even it itself follows a geodesic. In a different frame, $\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and we can consider the metric $g$ as the gravitational interactions potential
    \begin{equation*}
        \Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu} \sim g_{\mu\nu,\beta} ~.
    \end{equation*}

    The same reasoning can be applied to massless light. Infact the modulus of the parallely transported $4$-velocity $g(u, u)$ is conserved along a geodesic, since 
    \begin{equation*}
        0 = \nabla_u g(u,u) = 2 u^\nu u^\mu \nabla_\nu u_\mu = 2 u^\mu (u^\nu \nabla_\nu u_\mu) ~.
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore, by the principle of general covariance, in any reference frame, the modulus
    \begin{equation*}
        g(u,u) = \begin{cases}
            - 1 & \textnormal{for massive particles} \\
            0 & \textnormal{for light} \\
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    is conserved along a geodesic. However, for the light, there is no affine parsameter identified as proper time. This means that the metric encodes information about the causal structure of spacetime, because it governs the propagation of signals, like light.

\section{Gravitational sources}

    The metric $g$ is a $4 \times 4$ symmetric matrix that contains $10$ indepenent components. Hence, we need $10$ equation to completely indentify it, at most second order partial differential equations. The most reasonable guess for a tensor which contains the second derivative of the metric is the Einstein tensor 
    \begin{equation*}
        G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} ~.
    \end{equation*}
    Notice that, by the second Bianchi identity, i.e.
    \begin{equation*}
        G^\mu_{\phantom \mu \nu, \mu} = 0 ~,
    \end{equation*}
    which means that is covariantly conserved and there are only $6$ independent components. 

    The source tensor must have the same properties: it is a symmetric, covariantly conserved $(0,2)$ tensor, containing information about matter. By the weak equivalence principle, the strength of gravity interaction is measured by the proper mass, and in special relativity, mass and energy are equivalent. Hence, the reasonable guess it that the source of gravity is encoded in the energy-momentum tensor. 

    For a perfect fluid with $4$-velocity $u$, the energy-momentum tensor is 
    \begin{equation*}
        T = \rho u \otimes u + p (g^{-1} + u \otimes u) = (\rho + p) u \otimes u + p g^{-1} ~,
    \end{equation*}
    or, in components,
    \begin{equation*}
        T^{\mu\nu} = \rho u^\mu u^\nu + p (g^{\mu\nu} + u^\mu u^\nu) = (\rho + p) u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu\nu} ~,
    \end{equation*}
    where $\rho$ is the proper dentity and $p$ is the proper pressure, both measured by an observer comoving with the fluid, therefore it is a true scalar. 

    Notice that the pressure part is orthogonal to $u$
    \begin{equation*}
        (g^\mu\nu + u^\mu u^\nu) u_\nu = (g^{\mu\nu} + g^{\mu\nu} \underbrace{u^\mu u_\nu }_{-1}) u_\nu = g^{\mu\nu} - g^{\mu\nu} = 0~.
    \end{equation*}
    Infact, in the comoving frame, $u = (1, 0, 0, 0)$ and 
    \begin{equation*}
        T^{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
            \rho & 0 \\ 0 & p g^{ij} \\
        \end{bmatrix} ~,
    \end{equation*}
    or, equivalently, 
    \begin{equation*}
        T^\mu_{\phantom \mu \nu} = \begin{bmatrix}
            \rho & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & p & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & p & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & p \\
        \end{bmatrix} ~.
    \end{equation*}
    
    TO COMPLETE. 

    In a general reference frame, the continuity equation is written as 
    \begin{equation*}
        nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0 ~,
    \end{equation*}
    which enforces the natural candidate as the source of gravity. 

\section{Einstein's field equation} 

    The Einstein's field equations are therefore
    \begin{equation}\label{fieldeq}
        G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = k T_{\mu\nu} ~,
    \end{equation}
    where $k = 8 \pi G_N$, due to Newtonian regime.
    \begin{proof}
        In fact, $[G^{\mu\nu}] = L^{-2}$ whereas $[G^{\mu\nu}] = M L^{-3}$. This means that we require a coupling constant $[G_N] = \frac{L}{M}$. 
    \end{proof}

\section{Geodesic equation} 

    Straight lines are replaced by geodesic lines. However, the geodesic equation is a second order differential equation and we can see the connection term as a force. Hence, gravity is geometry. The Einstein's field equation are non-lineare, therefore the effects of two gravitational sources is not their sum. Furthermore, for dust $(p = 0)$, geodesic motion follows from the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. 
    \begin{proof}
        The energy-momentum tensor becomes
        \begin{equation*}
            T^{\mu\nu} = \rho u^\mu u^\nu ~.
        \end{equation*}
        Hence, 
        \begin{equation*}
            \rho u^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\nu = - u^\nu \nabla_\mu (\rho u^\mu ) \propto u^\nu 
        \end{equation*}
        and 
        \begin{equation*}
            \rho u^\mu (u_\nu \nabla_\mu u^\nu) \propto \nabla_\mu (u_\nu u^\nu) = 0 = \nabla_\mu (\rho u^\mu) ~,
        \end{equation*}
        where the affine parameter is the proper time.
    \end{proof}

    Unlike electromagnetism, we do not need a Lorentz-like force to completeley determine gravity.
