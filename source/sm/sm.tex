\chapter*{Introduction}

    In these lectures notes, we will cover the part of physics which studies systems composed by a large amount of constituents, like particles: thermodynamics and statistical mehcanics. In the first part, we will recall some notions of thermodynamics, in the language of differential geometry: the laws of thermodynamics and thermodynamics potentials. In the second part, we will study classical statistical mechanics, starting from the basic notions of classical (hamiltonian) mechanics till the $3$ ensembles: microcanonical, canonical and grancanonical. In the third part, we will study quantum statistical mechanics, starting from the basic notions of quantum mechanics, in the language of canonical and second quantisation, till the properties of bosons and fermions. At the end of each of these last $2$ parts, there will be some applications and exercises. In the last part, we will superficially introduce classical phase transitions and the classical Ising model.
