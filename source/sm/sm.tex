\chapter*{Abstract}

    In these notes, we will study the mathematical framework of statistical mechanics: the part of physics which focuses on systems composed by a large amount of microscopic constituents, like atoms or molecules. Statistical mechanics arises out from thermodynamics that deals with macroscopic physical quantities and it is able to explain them by means of the notions of ensemble and probability density distribution. In the first part, we will focus on classical systems, starting from some notions of thermodynamics in the language of differential geometry and classical Hamiltonian mechanics, passing through microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles, finishing with a superficial introduction of classical phase transitions. In the second part, we will focus on quantum systems: ensembles of identical particles in the language of second quantisation to describe Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein gases.
