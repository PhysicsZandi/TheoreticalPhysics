# Theoretical Physics

Hi, here you can find some study notes about topics involving theoretical physics, taken during the master degree. 

For the first semester:
1. [On differential geometry: manifolds and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/dg.pdf),
2. [On general relativity 1: Einstein's equations and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/gr1.pdf),
3. [On statistical mechanics: ensembles and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/sm.pdf),
4. [On group theory: groups, representations and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/lie.pdf),
5. [On relativistic quantum mechanics: first quantisation and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/rqm.pdf),
6. [On quantum field theory 1: second quantisation and all that](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/TheoreticalPhysics/blob/main/pdf/qft1.pdf).
